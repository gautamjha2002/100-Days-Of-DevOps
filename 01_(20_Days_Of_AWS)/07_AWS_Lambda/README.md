# Lambda 

Lambda function follows serverless architecture. It simply means when we run any application in serverless architecture (lambda function) performs the task in a compute instance/server and immediately tier down the server. 

- lambda take care of resources that is needed to run the application. 
- Automatic scaling (up and down) is available with lambda.  
- Lambda functions are event driven that means it cannot be run by itself manually. 

## Use of Serverless architecture as DevOps engineer. 
- We can do cost optization using Lambda functions. 
- Security/compliance :- we can check if any resource is created without taking care of security. (for example created S3 with public access.)  
- Perform regular routine activities.
